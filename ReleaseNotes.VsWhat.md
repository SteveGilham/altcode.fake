# 20.12.10.26
* Use WsWhere 1.1.0 release
* Support for .net5.0 (actually all runtimes > 2.1)

# 18.11.20.18
* Use WsWhere 1.0.0 release
* Since this is a tool, not an API, go for a date-based versioning that puts this ahead of the inadvertent (and de-listed) "5.9.3.14-pre" release.

# 1.0.11
* [NEW PACKAGE] `AltCode.VsWhat` containing a global to list Visual Studio instances and their installed packages; a thin wrapper over [BlackFox.VsWhere](https://github.com/vbfox/FoxSharp/blob/master/src/BlackFox.VsWhere/Readme.md) to make this one specific query. See Wiki entry [The `AltCode.VsWhat` package](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcode.Fake/wiki/The-AltCode.VsWhat-package)
